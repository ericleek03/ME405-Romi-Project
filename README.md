# ME405-Romi-Project

The project involves the use of a Romi robot from Pololu. The robot has been constructed with two motors and encoders, as well as a STM32 nucleo board. The main objective of using the Romi robot is to learn the hardware and software to control the robot to complete different tasks. Initially, the group started by learning simple controls to manipulate LED and understand callbacks. Encoder and motor files were constructed to understand the use of classes. With more understanding of the hardware of the robot, the group lead to constructing tasks with generators in order to concurrently run multiple objectives at once. Objectives included the UI_task, line following task, state estimation task, as well as bump sensing. With these different tasks, the final assignment was to follow a map constructed by the instructor and navigate through the course with the knowledge that we have gained from the quarter.
